### Technology Stack

- **React 18**: Modern UI framework with hooks
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development with strict mode
- **Vite**: Fast build tool with hot module replacement
- **ESLint + Prettier**: Code quality and formatting
- **CSS-in-JS**: Styled components with professional dark theme

### Key Systems

#### Event Engine

The event system uses a custom DSL (Domain Specific Language) for authoring game events:

```json
{
  "id": "hunt_success",
  "name": "Successful Hunt",
  "text": "The hunting party returns with a large elk!",
  "conditions": [
    "pack.wolves.filter(w => w.role === 'hunter').length >= 2",
    "season === 'summer'"
  ],
  "effects": [
    "targetWolf.stats.health += 10",
    "pack.logs.push(`${targetWolf.name} gained confidence from the hunt!`)"
  ],
  "weight": 0.3
}
```

#### Genetics System

Breeding combines parental traits with realistic inheritance patterns:

- **Base inheritance**: Average of parent stats with ¬±1 mutation
- **Genetic diversity**: Encourages varied pairings
- **Fertility factors**: Age and trait-based breeding success
- **Bond bonuses**: Relationship strength affects compatibility

#### Save System

Robust save management with multiple features:

- **Auto-save**: Every 10 simulated days
- **Manual saves**: User-named save slots (max 10)
- **Import/Export**: JSON-based save sharing
- **Version control**: Save compatibility tracking

## üîß Configuration

### Game Configuration

Modify `src/engine/simulation.ts` to adjust game parameters:

```typescript
export const DEFAULT_CONFIG: GameConfig = {
  daysPerSeason: 40, // Days per season cycle
  eventsPerDay: { min: 2, max: 4 }, // Random events per day
  gestationDays: 14, // Pregnancy duration
  trainingStartAge: 40, // Training eligibility (days)
  trainingDuration: 40, // Training completion time
  maxLifespan: { min: 12, max: 14 }, // Wolf lifespan range
  xpToLevel: 100, // Experience points per level
  healerHerbsPerTend: 1, // Herbs consumed per healing
  healHpRange: { min: 15, max: 25 }, // Healing amount range
  healerBaseSuccessRate: 0.9, // Base healing success rate
  seasonalModifiers: {
    /* ... */
  }, // Season-specific bonuses
};
```

### Adding Custom Events

Create new events in `src/data/events_examples.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "custom_event",
  "name": "Your Custom Event",
  "text": "Something interesting happens...",
  "conditions": ["/* JavaScript conditions */"],
  "effects": ["/* JavaScript effects */"],
  "targetType": "wolf", // or "pack"
  "weight": 0.2,
  "rarity": "common" // "common", "uncommon", "rare", "legendary"
}
```

## üìà Development

### Code Quality

- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Full type safety enforcement
- **ESLint Configuration**: Comprehensive linting rules
- **Prettier Integration**: Automatic code formatting
- **Git Hooks**: Pre-commit quality checks

### Testing Strategy

```bash
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:watch         # Watch mode for development
npm run test:coverage      # Generate coverage report
```

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build              # Create optimized production build
npm run preview            # Test production build locally
```

The production build is optimized with:

- Code splitting for faster loading
- Tree shaking to remove unused code
- Asset optimization and compression
- Source maps for debugging

- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Include tests for new features
- Update documentation for API changes

### Code Style

- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer immutable data patterns
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Follow the established file organization

## üìä Game Balance

### Wolf Stats Range

- **Health**: 0-100 (current condition)
- **Core Stats**: 0-10 (strength, speed, intelligence)
- **Traits**: 0-10 (bravery, sociability, trainability, fertility)

### Breeding Mechanics

- **Optimal Age**: 2-8 years for best fertility
- **Genetic Diversity**: Encouraged through compatibility scoring
- **Mutation Rate**: ¬±1 stat variance from parent average
- **Litter Size**: 1-4 pups (weighted probability)

### Event Frequency

- **Daily Events**: 2-4 random events per simulated day
- **Seasonal Modifiers**: Spring births, winter hardships
- **Rarity Distribution**: 60% common, 25% uncommon, 12% rare, 3% legendary

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations

- Events are read-only during gameplay (no dynamic event creation)
- AI for rival packs is simplified
- No multiplayer functionality
- Limited sound/visual effects

### Performance Notes

- Save files can become large with extensive play sessions
- Event history is maintained indefinitely (may impact performance)
- No lazy loading for large wolf populations

### Future Enhancements

- Dynamic event system with user-created events
- Enhanced AI for rival pack behaviors
- Multiplayer pack interactions
- Advanced genetics with recessive traits
- Achievement system and challenges
