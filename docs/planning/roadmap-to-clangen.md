## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture Overview**

### **Current System Architecture**

#### **Core Engine Layer** (`src/engine/`)

```
simulation.ts     // Main simulation loop and day processing
patrol.ts         // Patrol system (4 types, outcomes, scheduling)
eventEngine.ts    // Event processing with custom DSL
mating.ts         // Breeding and relationship systems
combat.ts         // Battle resolution mechanics
healer.ts         // Healing and prophecy systems
training.ts       // Experience and skill development
```

#### **Type System** (`src/types/`)

```
wolf.ts           // Wolf stats, traits, roles, family trees
pack.ts           // Pack state, game config, seasons
patrol.ts         // Patrol types, outcomes, assignments
event.ts          // Event templates, conditions, DSL
territory.ts      // Territory and rival pack management
utils.ts          // Utility functions and helpers
```

#### **UI Layer** (`src/ui/components/`)

```
PatrolPanel.tsx   // Patrol management interface (NEW)
Roster.tsx        // Wolf listing and filtering
Profile.tsx       // Individual wolf details
HealerPanel.tsx   // Healing and prophecy interface
GeneticsViewer.tsx // Breeding and family trees
SaveLoadPanel.tsx // Save/load management
```

#### **Data Layer** (`src/data/`)

```
events_examples.json     // Event templates
starter_wolves.json      // Initial pack configuration
mating_events.json       // Breeding-specific events
relationship_events.json // Social interaction events
```

### **Key Design Patterns**

#### **1. Event-Driven Architecture**

- Custom DSL for event conditions and effects
- Template-based event system for easy content creation
- JavaScript evaluation for dynamic event logic

```javascript
// Example event condition
"wolf.stats.health > 50 && pack.season === 'winter'";

// Example event effect
'wolf.stats.health += 10; pack.logs.push(`${wolf.name} recovered!`)';
```

#### **2. Modular Engine System**

- Singleton simulation engine with pluggable systems
- Separate engines for mating, patrol, events, etc.
- Configuration-driven behavior modification

#### **3. Type-Safe State Management**

- Comprehensive TypeScript types for all game entities
- Runtime validation with Zod schemas
- Immutable state updates in React components

#### **4. Extensible Configuration**

```typescript
// Game balance through configuration
export const DEFAULT_CONFIG: GameConfig = {
  daysPerSeason: 40,
  eventsPerDay: { min: 2, max: 4 },
  patrolSystem: {
    minHuntingPatrolsPerMonth: 2,
    minBorderPatrolsPerMonth: 1,
    baseSuccessRate: 0.7,
  },
  // ... extensive configuration options
};
```

## 👥 **Developer Handoff Information**

### **Getting Started**

#### **Setup and Development**

```bash
cd packgen-web
npm install                 # Install dependencies
npm run dev                # Start development server
npm run build              # Build for production
npm run test               # Run Jest test suite
npm run lint               # Check TypeScript and code style
```

#### **Key Development Commands**

```bash
npm run format             # Auto-format with Prettier
npm run preview            # Preview production build
```

### **Code Organization Principles**

#### **File Naming Conventions**

- **Components**: PascalCase (`PatrolPanel.tsx`)
- **Types**: camelCase files, PascalCase interfaces (`wolf.ts` → `Wolf`)
- **Engines**: camelCase with descriptive names (`patrol.ts`)
- **Data**: kebab-case with descriptive suffixes (`starter_wolves.json`)

#### **Import/Export Patterns**

```typescript
// Centralized component exports
export { PatrolPanel } from './PatrolPanel';
export { Roster } from './Roster';
// ... in src/ui/components/index.ts

// Engine imports
import { simulationEngine } from '../engine/simulation';
import { PatrolEngine } from '../engine/patrol';
```

#### **State Management Pattern**

```typescript
// Pack state flows down, updates flow up
const [pack, setPack] = useState<Pack>(initialPack);

// Engine methods don't mutate, they return results
const patrolResults = patrolEngine.processScheduledPatrols(pack);

// UI components update pack through callbacks
const handlePatrolAssign = (assignment: PatrolAssignment) => {
  const updatedPack = { ...pack };
  updatedPack.assignedPatrols.push(assignment);
  onPackUpdate(updatedPack);
};
```

### **Testing Strategy**

#### **Current Test Coverage**

```bash
tests/mating-system.test.ts  # Breeding and relationship tests
```

#### **Test Patterns**

```typescript
// Engine testing approach
describe('Patrol System', () => {
  test('creates valid patrol assignments', () => {
    const engine = new PatrolEngine(DEFAULT_CONFIG);
    const assignment = engine.createPatrolAssignment('hunting', wolves, pack);
    expect(assignment.type).toBe('hunting');
    expect(assignment.participants.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  });
});
```

### **Performance Considerations**

#### **Current Optimizations**

- Immutable state updates minimize re-renders
- Efficient wolf filtering with role-based indexing
- Lazy loading of UI components
- Build-time tree shaking with Vite

#### **Scaling Considerations**

- Event engine designed for 1000+ events
- Pack size tested up to 50+ wolves
- Simulation performs well at 10x speed
- Save files remain under 1MB for large packs

### **Known Technical Debt**

#### **Areas for Future Improvement**

1. **Event Engine Type Safety**: Current DSL uses `any` types for flexibility
2. **Component Prop Drilling**: Some deep prop passing could use context
3. **Save File Migration**: Need robust migration system for new features
4. **Mobile Responsiveness**: UI designed primarily for desktop
5. **Accessibility**: Limited screen reader and keyboard navigation support

### **Extension Points**

#### **Adding New Patrol Types**

1. Update `PatrolType` union in `src/types/patrol.ts`
2. Add template in `PatrolEngine.loadDefaultPatrols()`
3. Update UI patrol type arrays and switch statements
4. Add role eligibility logic in `getAvailableWolves()`

#### **Adding New Event Types**

1. Create event templates in `src/data/`
2. Extend event conditions/effects DSL if needed
3. Load templates in `App.tsx` initialization
4. Test with new event scenarios

#### **Adding New UI Tabs**

1. Add tab type to `TabType` union in `App.tsx`
2. Create new component in `src/ui/components/`
3. Export from `index.ts`
4. Add tab configuration and content in `App.tsx`

## 📝 **Development Notes**

### **Architecture Decisions**

#### **Why TypeScript + React?**

- **Type safety** prevents common bugs in complex simulations
- **Component reusability** speeds up UI development
- **Modern tooling** provides excellent developer experience
- **Web deployment** requires no installation for users

#### **Why Custom Event DSL?**

- **Content creator friendly** - events can be written by non-programmers
- **Performance** - compiled JavaScript evaluation vs interpreted logic
- **Flexibility** - can express complex conditions and effects
- **Extensibility** - easy to add new condition/effect types

#### **Why Singleton Engines?**

- **Consistent state** across all game systems
- **Easy testing** with predictable engine instances
- **Configuration management** through single engine instances
- **Performance** - avoid engine recreation overhead

### **Content Creation Guidelines**

#### **Event Writing Best Practices**

```javascript
// Good event structure
{
  "id": "unique_descriptive_name",
  "title": "Player-Visible Title",
  "text": "Engaging narrative with {wolf.name} placeholders",
  "condition": { "all": [
    { "field": "wolf.role", "op": "==", "value": "hunter" },
    { "field": "pack.season", "op": "==", "value": "winter" }
  ]},
  "actions": [
    { "type": "modify_stat", "target": "wolf", "stat": "stats.health", "delta": -10 },
    { "type": "log", "text": "{wolf.name} was injured while hunting in the cold." }
  ],
  "weight": 5,
  "tags": ["hunting", "winter", "injury"]
}
```

#### **Patrol Template Guidelines**

```typescript
// Well-balanced patrol outcomes
outcomes: [
  { outcome: 'success', weight: 50 }, // Most common
  { outcome: 'major_success', weight: 15 }, // Rare positive
  { outcome: 'failure', weight: 25 }, // Common negative
  { outcome: 'disaster', weight: 10 }, // Rare negative
];
```
